"# roche-papier-ciseau" 

The purpose of this project is to implement the (rock paper scissors) game using the assembly language Pep8.
To do so, a first implementation has been done with Java. Note that the Pep8 class is here to simulate how Pep8 work
with inputs and outputs. Then, this code has been translated into Pep8 assembly code.
